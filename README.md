# Advanced and in-depth learning resources for Vue.js
While it's quite easy to find tutorials about Vue.js things are getting much harder when you want to learn it in-depth. This list is for eveyone willing to learn advanced Vue.js techniques and how sth works in-depth. I hope that in the near future this list will make it much easier for everyone to learn advanced and non-trivial Vue stuff. 

**All of the listed resources are dedicated for developers who are already familiar with Vue.js and have some prior experience with this framework.**

If you know some courses/articles about advanced Vue patterns, in-depth explainations or just non-trivial stuff that would be helpful for other vue develoeprs please don't hesitate to share them!
